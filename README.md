# DES103 Final Project: Pomodoro Timer

## Short Description

This **Pomodoro Timer** program is a productivity tool designed for work and study. It utilizes the Pomodoro technique, which uses a timer to break down work into two intervals of 25 minutes each, separated by short breaks. After completing four work sessions, a longer break is taken. This technique has been proven to effectively improve focus and productivity.

For example, users might study for 25 minutes, take a 5-minute break, study for another 25 minutes, take another 5-minute break, and so on. After completing four study sessions, the user might take a 30-minute break to rest and recharge. Then they can resume studying with another Pomodoro cycle until they finish studying for the day.

## Features

- Customizable work/break durations: Users can customize the length of work and break intervals based on their preferences and needs.
- Color customization: The program allows users to choose their preferred color theme for a personalized experience.
- Productivity enhancement: By following the Pomodoro technique, users can maintain focus, avoid distractions, and improve their overall productivity during work and study sessions.
